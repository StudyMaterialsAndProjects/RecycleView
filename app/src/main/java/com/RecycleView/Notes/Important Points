RecycleView
----------
In earlier android we were using Custom Base Adapter for showing the list of items.
We can display the collection of Strings,collection of java Objects in the item.

To Bridge a gap that is converting the Non-UI  elements to UI elemts we will use a Adapter.
i.e to show the list of Strings to list of items.

Disadvantages of Using Base Adapter.

Here the View is getting inflated every time when we scroll.
Each time creating a new View Object.Can be observed in the Log.
