RecycleView
----------
In earlier android we were using Custom Base Adapter for showing the list of items.
We can display the collection of Strings,collection of java Objects in the item.

To Bridge a gap that is converting the Non-UI  elements to UI elemts we will use a Adapter.
i.e to show the list of Strings to list of items.


The main Reason switching from ArrayAdapter to Base Adapter is
In ArrayAdapter we can show only String type Arrays.
If we want to show Object type non-Ui elements into UI elements then we should go for Base Adapter.

Disadvantages of Using Base Adapter.

Here the View is getting inflated every time when we scroll.
Each time creating a new View Object.Can be observed in the Log.
we can verify it by adding a set for verification.

There is no Documenatation that why the getView() method will be executed so many times.
Google Io link for that getView() method executing multiple times as suggested by google-->https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDBM6wVEO70
getView()  method will be executed a couple of times depending on how the widgets are alligned in the layout.


OverComing the View Executing again and again.
